# git commits
* When making a git commit, put everything in one line, all lowercase. Do not mention it was coded w/ claude.
* You can make commits sometimes but never push the changes

# comments
Do not add any comments to code. If modifying existing code, you can update comments as needed

## plan mode
* Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
* At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any
